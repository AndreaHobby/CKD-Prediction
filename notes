Slide Title: Harmonization and Standardization: How USCDI+ is Raising Data Quality at HRSA

Overview:

USCDI (United States Core Data for Interoperability): Fundamental data set ensuring consistent, interoperable data across healthcare.

Application in HRSA: Focused on enhancing data quality and standardization.

CMS Quality Initiatives: Incorporating USCDI in FHIR-based reporting for electronic clinical quality measures (eCQMs).

Current Challenges:

Data Alignment: Lack of uniform organization of data elements.

Resource Distribution: Unequal allocation affecting harmonization efforts.

Workflow Standardization: Complex and varied workflows resist uniform practices.

Regulatory Constraints: Payment structures impacting accountability.

Interoperability Issues: Difficulties in achieving seamless data exchange.

Key Stakeholders & Contributions:

NCI (National Cancer Institute):

Developing FHIR Implementation Guides for cancer data.

Enhancing research through standardized data collection (e.g., Cancer Immunology Data Commons).

Challenges: Data cleaning and coordination, labor-intensive cancer registry data collection.

CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention):

Mission focused on aligning data standards without increasing reporting burden.

Emphasizes minimum necessary data for public health responses.

HRSA's Approach:

Transition from manual UDS (Uniform Data System) reporting to UDS+ using USCDI standards and FHIR-based connections.

Successful pilot involving 4 million patients, lauded at ASTP Annual Meeting.

Benefits of USCDI+ Adoption:

Reduced Reporting Burden: Streamlined processes for health centers.

Expanded Data Elements: New race/ethnicity data standards easing data capture.

Enhanced Data Quality: More reliable data supporting public health and research.

Collaboration Potential: Strengthening data-sharing frameworks and fostering better evaluation discussions.

Future Steps & Recommendations:

Clear Guidance & Support: Further clarity needed from ASTP.

Vendor Engagement: Collaborate with EHR vendors for effective data capture.

Implementation Timeline: Ensure reasonable timelines for health centers to adapt.

Conclusion:

Harmonization efforts through USCDI+ pave the way for higher quality, interoperable data, benefiting public health outcomes and reducing data burdens.
